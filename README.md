## clip_filenames.bat
scans a single directory of files (place the bat file in the directory)   
copies onto the clipboard all the specified (.wav, .mp3) filenames in the directory into a format that can be pasted into a Matlab drop-down interactable object, so those files do not have to be manually input one-by-one
